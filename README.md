# CanLauncher
Code for the can

This repo contains all files for the intelligent can launching system dubbed 
as the Pop Popper. It has the capability to detect a face, find the distance,
and set launch angles and launch velocities to have the can make it to the 
target. For more information, please reach out to me and I would love to discuss
with you. 

Also, the full article/recap can be found on my LinkedIn:
